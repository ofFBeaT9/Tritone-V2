# Test Program: Data Movement Instructions
# Tests: LDI, MOV, LDT (load from table), STT (store to table)
# Coverage: Immediate loads, register moves, memory operations

# Test LDI (Load Immediate)
LDI R1, -1     # Load -1 into R1
LDI R2, 0      # Load 0 into R2
LDI R3, 1      # Load 1 into R3
LDI R4, 13     # Load larger positive value
LDI R5, -13    # Load larger negative value

# Test MOV (Move between registers)
MOV R6, R1     # Copy R1 to R6 (should be -1)
MOV R7, R3     # Copy R3 to R7 (should be 1)
MOV R8, R4     # Copy R4 to R8 (should be 13)

# Verify MOV worked correctly
SUB R0, R6, R1  # Should be zero if R6 = R1
SUB R0, R7, R3  # Should be zero if R7 = R3
SUB R0, R8, R4  # Should be zero if R8 = R4

# Test STT (Store to Table/Memory)
LDI R1, 100    # Address for first store
LDI R2, 42     # Data value 1
STT R2, R1     # Store 42 to address 100

LDI R1, 101    # Address for second store
LDI R3, -27    # Data value 2
STT R3, R1     # Store -27 to address 101

LDI R1, 102    # Address for third store
LDI R4, 13     # Data value 3
STT R4, R1     # Store 13 to address 102

# Test LDT (Load from Table/Memory)
LDI R1, 100    # Load from first address
LDT R5, R1     # Should load 42 into R5

LDI R1, 101    # Load from second address
LDT R6, R1     # Should load -27 into R6

LDI R1, 102    # Load from third address
LDT R7, R1     # Should load 13 into R7

# Verify memory round-trip
LDI R8, 42     # Expected value 1
SUB R0, R5, R8  # Check if R5 = 42

LDI R8, -27    # Expected value 2
SUB R0, R6, R8  # Check if R6 = -27

LDI R8, 13     # Expected value 3
SUB R0, R7, R8  # Check if R7 = 13
