# test_shift.btasm - Test shift instructions
# Tests: SHL (shift left), SHR (shift right)

# Prepare test values
LDI R1, 1          # R1 = 1
LDI R2, 2          # R2 = 2  
LDI R3, 4          # R3 = 4

# Test SHL (shift left by 1 position = multiply by 3 in ternary)
SHL R4, R1         # R4 = 1 << 1 = 3
SHL R5, R2         # R5 = 2 << 1 = 6
SHL R6, R3         # R6 = 4 << 1 = 12

# Test SHR (shift right by 1 position = divide by 3 in ternary)
SHR R7, R6         # R7 = 12 >> 1 = 4
SHR R8, R4         # R8 = 3 >> 1 = 1

# Test shift of zero
SHL R1, R0         # R1 = 0 << 1 = 0
SHR R2, R0         # R2 = 0 >> 1 = 0

# Verify shift operations
LDI R1, 3
SUB R0, R4, R1     # R4 should be 3
LDI R1, 6
SUB R0, R5, R1     # R5 should be 6
