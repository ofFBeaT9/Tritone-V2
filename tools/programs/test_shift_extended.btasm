# Test SHL with positive numbers
LDI R1, 1           # R1 = 1
SHL R2, R1          # R2 = 1 * 3 = 3
SHL R3, R2          # R3 = 3 * 3 = 9
SHL R4, R3          # R4 = 9 * 3 = 27

# Test SHR (reverse of SHL)
SHR R5, R4          # R5 = 27 / 3 = 9
SHR R6, R5          # R6 = 9 / 3 = 3
SHR R7, R6          # R7 = 3 / 3 = 1

# Verify round-trip: R7 should equal R1
SUB R8, R7, R1      # Should be 0

# Test with negative numbers
LDI R1, -1          # R1 = -1
SHL R2, R1          # R2 = -1 * 3 = -3
SHL R3, R2          # R3 = -3 * 3 = -9

# Test SHR with negative
SHR R4, R3          # R4 = -9 / 3 = -3
SHR R5, R4          # R5 = -3 / 3 = -1

# Test SHL/SHR on zero
SHL R6, R0          # 0 * 3 = 0
SHR R7, R0          # 0 / 3 = 0

# Test larger values
LDI R1, 13          # R1 = 13
SHL R2, R1          # R2 = 13 * 3 = 39
SHR R3, R2          # R3 = 39 / 3 = 13

# Verify: R3 should equal R1
SUB R8, R3, R1      # Should be 0
