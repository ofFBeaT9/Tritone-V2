# Expected Output for counter.btasm
#
# After execution completes (HALT):

## Registers
R0 = 0          # Hardwired zero
R1 = 5          # Final counter value
R2 = 5          # Loop limit
R3 = 5          # Final memory address

## Memory (first 5 words)
Mem[0] = 1
Mem[1] = 2
Mem[2] = 3
Mem[3] = 4
Mem[4] = 5

## Status
halted = 1      # CPU halted
pc_out = 6      # PC at HALT instruction

## Verification Criteria
1. R1 == 5 (counter reached limit)
2. R2 == 5 (limit unchanged)
3. Mem[4] == 5 (last value stored)
4. halted == 1 (CPU stopped)
