# Tritone Demo: Simple Counter
#
# This program counts from 1 to 5 and stores results in memory.
# Used to verify basic CPU functionality.
#
# Expected registers after execution:
#   R1 = 5 (final count)
#   R2 = 5 (loop limit)
#
# Expected memory:
#   Mem[0] = 1
#   Mem[1] = 2
#   Mem[2] = 3
#   Mem[3] = 4
#   Mem[4] = 5

    # Initialize
    LDI  R1, 0        # R1 = counter (starts at 0)
    LDI  R2, 5        # R2 = limit
    LDI  R3, 0        # R3 = memory address

loop:
    ADDI R1, R1, 1    # counter++
    ST   R3, R1       # Mem[R3] = counter
    ADDI R3, R3, 1    # address++
    BNE  R1, R2, loop # if counter != limit, loop

    HALT              # Done
